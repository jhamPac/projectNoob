So this is kind of like a guide for anyone just starting out in web development. I started this project because it helps me keep track of my perosonal development as a web dev and it is the actual guide too, so I am killing two birds with one stone. I will try to comment the best I can as I go along to help you follow what I was thinking at the time. Try the following strategies to get the most out of this guide.

STRATEGIES

========================================

Try to replicate what I did on each page. Do not just copy the code itself what I mean is if I created a nav button on a page you should do that too using what ever method you want. 

Each page has different things that I have tried to help me understand a particular concept. For instance there is a page where it only contains a form. That page and the .php file that has the code for the form is something you should do also, again do not just copy the code but build it yourself. 

I jumped around a little bit as far as languages and concepts but I have found that is the best way to learn. Sometimes when you see the differences in a language and technology it helps you understand web developent as a whole a lot better. It also helps you learn more about a particular language too. For example do a task/script in php and try to do that same task/script in javascript and that will help you understand the individual languages a lot better. 

Oh and some really good advice, try to code everyday. Even if its just for a little bit, do it EVERYDAY. Read about it, write about it, think about it everyday. Thinking about it everyday helps your brain stay in "PROGRAMMING" mode and it all starts to make more sense. 

Learn everything, don't just learn one language or one side of web dev. It all works together and the better you understand the whole picture the better and faster you ll be at becoming a good web dev. GO FOR THE FULL STACK, front end, back end, side end whatever end just learn it all.
